# Credit-Fraud-Risk-Model
To build a classifier model to predict the likelihood of credit card applicants becoming a fraud or not 

# Project Objectives:
•	Implement Fraud Risk model to classify the applicants as fraudulent or legitimate at the time of application <br>
•	Identify the seasonality trends in fraudulent accounts <br>
•	Explore whether the fraud rates have trended up or down over time <br>
•	Explore and identify differences in the fraud rate between different products offered by the company <br>
